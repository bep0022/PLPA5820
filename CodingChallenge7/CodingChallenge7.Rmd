## Question 1: 
```{r}
# Load in data
plant <- read.csv("PlantEmergence.csv")
#View(plant)

# Load in packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4) 
library(emmeans)
library(multcomp)
library(multcompView)

# Set variables as factors
plant$Treatment <- as.factor(plant$Treatment) # Set Treatment variable as factor
plant$DaysAfterPlanting <- as.factor(plant$DaysAfterPlanting) # Set DaysAfterPlanting as factor
plant$Rep <- as.factor(plant$Rep) # Set Rep as factor

```

## Question 2:
Fit a linear model to predict Emergence using Treatment and
DaysAfterPlanting along with the interaction. Provide the summary of the linear
model and ANOVA results.
```{r}
Emergence_int <- lm(Emergence~Treatment + DaysAfterPlanting + Treatment:DaysAfterPlanting, data = plant)
summary(Emergence_int)
```
```{r}
anova(Emergence_int)
```

## Question 3:
Based on the results of the linear model in question 2, do you need to fit the
interaction term? 
- None of the interactions are significant, so no.
Provide a simplified linear model without the interaction term but still
testing both main effects. Provide the summary and ANOVA results. 
```{r}
Emergence_lm <- lm(Emergence~Treatment + DaysAfterPlanting, data = plant)
summary(Emergence_lm)
```
```{r}
anova(Emergence_lm)
```
Then, interpret the
intercept and the coefficient for Treatment 2.
- The intercept (182.163) is the estimated value of the dependent variable (Emergence) when all independent variables are at their reference. 
- The coefficient for Treatment 2 (-134.531) indicates the estimated change in the dependent variable (Emergence) when Treatment 2 is compared to the reference category (Treatment 1).

## Question 4:
Calculate the least square means for Treatment using the emmeans package and
perform a Tukey separation with the compact letter display using the cld function.
Interpret the results.
- The groups that do not share the same numbers in the .group column are significantly different from each other. For example, groups 5, 3, and 6 are significantly different from groups 8, 4, 9, and 1.
```{r}
lsmeans <- emmeans(Emergence_lm, ~Treatment)
Results_lsmeans <- cld(lsmeans, alpha = 0.05, reversed = TRUE, details = TRUE) # contrast with Tukey ajustment
Results_lsmeans
```

## Question 5:
The provided function lets you dynamically add a linear model plus one factor from
that model and plots a bar chart with letters denoting treatment differences. Use this
model to generate the plot shown below. Explain the significance of the letters.
- The letters represent the difference between the treatment groups. For example, only Treatment 2 has "c" so it is significantly different from all the Treatments with "ab", "a", or "b".  
```{r}
# Create Function

plot_cldbars_onefactor <- function(lm_model, factor) {
  data <- lm_model$model
  variables <- colnames(lm_model$model)
  dependent_var <- variables[1]
  independent_var <- variables[2:length(variables)]

  lsmeans <- emmeans(lm_model, as.formula(paste("~", factor))) # estimate lsmeans 
  Results_lsmeans <- cld(lsmeans, alpha = 0.05, reversed = TRUE, details = TRUE, Letters = letters) # contrast with Tukey adjustment by default.
  
  # Extracting the letters for the bars
  sig.diff.letters <- data.frame(Results_lsmeans$emmeans[,1], 
                                 str_trim(Results_lsmeans$emmeans[,7]))
  colnames(sig.diff.letters) <- c(factor, "Letters")
  
  # for plotting with letters from significance test
  ave_stand2 <- lm_model$model %>%
    group_by(!!sym(factor)) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(
      ave.emerge = mean(.data[[dependent_var]], na.rm = TRUE),
      se = sd(.data[[dependent_var]]) / sqrt(n())
    ) %>%
    left_join(sig.diff.letters, by = factor) %>%
    mutate(letter_position = ave.emerge + 10 * se)
  
  plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = !! sym(factor), y = !! sym(dependent_var))) + 
    stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "bar") +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.5) +
    ylab("Number of emerged plants") + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.02, alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_text(data = ave_stand2, aes(label = Letters, y = letter_position), size = 5) +
    xlab(as.character(factor)) +
    theme_classic()
  
  return(plot)
}

# Use function for plot of linear model with variable Treatment
plot_cldbars_onefactor(Emergence_lm, "Treatment")

```

## Question 6
Generate the gfm .md file along with a .html, .docx, or .pdf. Commit, and push the
.md file to github and turn in the .html, .docx, or .pdf to Canvas. Provide me a link here to
your github.
